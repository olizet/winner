# winner
Welcome to my first project on github. 
My Application called Winner is about sharing predictions for sport events with other users. 
##Getting started
To get started you have to connect to mySQL in file "/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml"

```
<property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/winner" />
<property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.user" value="<user>" />
<property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.password" value="<password?" />
```
If you want you can use sample of database prepared by me. It's already uploaded -> winner.sql

Next step is to set up a server.

After this operation, application is ready to start
